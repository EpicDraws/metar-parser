= LALR Parser

The first version of metar uses the dhaka parser gem.

== Dhaka

* Home: http://dhaka.rubyforge.org/doc/index.html
* RDoc: http://dhaka.rubyforge.org/

== Development

* Made a tokenizer specification, which identifies different sections of input and labels them,
* Made a grammar, which specifies which tokens follow which.
** The main structural point is that there are two sub-grammars: International and United States.

== Use

If you want the GraphVix dot graph:

  tokens = Metar::Lexer.lex('LIRQ 031220Z VRB02KT 5000 -DZ BKN025 BKN070 04/01 Q1020')
  parser = Metar::Parser.parse(tokens)
  parser.save_dot('foo.dot')
